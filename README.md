# ParseAudioFileExample
Record, upload, retrieve and play mp3 files with Parse.com

A sample Android application that shows how you can record and upload a mp3 file on Parse.com and then how to retrieve and play it!
This is a very basic application, this code isn't optimized, so it can freeze sometimes when you try to play an mp3 file.
